# Bonus: Tutorials (Group Work)

This work is completely optional and will count as a bonus to the whole group.

## Introduction

There are various amazing packages in R which we do not have the time to cover. But, you can contribute to promotion of these packages with a good tutorial! In this project, you are expected to introduce a substantial package and work on a simple but illustrative example. Your work should consist of two parts.

1. A written tutorial (or vignette) from the start to the end on RMarkdown with code, data and explanations.
2. A video tutorial of presentation, live coding and commentary (3-7 minutes).

Your work should be completely reproducible. Your presentation should include the names of the members. Upload your work and videos on your Group Progress Journals.

##Â Deadline

Final presentation deadline is September 10, 2020.

## Packages

These are R packages which you are expected to create tutorials on. You might suggest different R packages (subject to instructor's approval).
